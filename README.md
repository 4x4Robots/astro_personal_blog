# Learning astro with a project

I'm following [this tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) to get started with astro and try to create a personal blog.

## Deployment

This [blog post](https://valstar.dev/blog/2022-09-06-astro-caddy-hosting/) provides a detailed description for self hosting with caddy.

### Local testing

You can run a local development server with 

```sh
npm run dev
```
